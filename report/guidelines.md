This report should describe how you met criteria. You should be able to point to instances in your application where the criteria have been met. This document is for your protection!! If the grader/instructor has to search your application to find the places where you met the criteria, then they may miss where you met the criteria. This document should be like you looking over the shoulder of the grader and saying, "Yeah, right there is where I use the proper MVC architecture." By explicitly identifying how you met the criteria, the grader/TAs can be sure they are not missing something. Easy to find things = makes grader happy and ensures nothing is missed = good grade.
